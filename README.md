# Make Harbors Great Again
---
This is a mod that will focus on buffing Harbors
---

With the recent change to Harbors (+1 trade route exclusive with Commercial Hub), Harbors feel even more lackluster than they already did. For the most part, there is little incentive to build Harbors now. In this project, I will be updating Harbors and their buildings to make them more competitive while still respecting trade route exclusivity with Commercial Hubs.

North Stars for this project:

- Players should have a compelling decision when deciding between building a Harbor or a Commercial Hub
- Harbors should benefit maritime civs
- Harbors should benefit cities with sea resources (bonus)
- Harbors should benefit cities with sea resources (luxury)
- Coastal cities should always benefit from building a Harbor
- Island cities should almost always want to build a Harbor before a Commercial Hub
- Cities on different continents should benefit from building a Harbor
- Players should have compelling decisions around building additional cities on islands or different continents so that they can construct additional Harbors
